PS(1) User Commands

NAME 
ps - report process status

SYNOPSIS 
ps

DESCRIPTION
The ps command displays information about active processes in the system.

OUTPUT
For each process, the following information is displayed:

PID: Process ID
PPID: Parent Process ID
STATE: Current state of the process
SIZE: Size of the process in bytes
NAME: Name of the process

The STATE field can have one of the following values:
unused
used
sleep
runble (runnable)
run
zombie

EXIT STATUS
The ps command exits 0 on success, and 1 if an error occurs.

This implementation of ps uses the getprocs() system call to retrieve process information. It can display information for up to NPROC processes (defined in param.h).

EXAMPLES
To display information about all processes:
$ ps

Future Development

- Add support for outputting command line (argv[0]) and arguments (argv[1..n]) instead of process name.
- Add support for -t flag to output process information by parent/child in tree format
